## 1. Scope

This file owns chat-specific context that used to make the root `CONTEXT.md` too large.

Included here:
- Home chat rooms, DMs, public/private topic rooms, synthetic entries, and game-backed room chat.
- Home/Dashboard chat center, room rail, and embedded Rooms chat surfaces.
- Message composer, replies, edits, deletes, reactions, pinned messages, ignores, overlays, and autocomplete.
- Synthetic chat entries: RSS, News, Mentions/Notifications, Showcase, Work, and Discover.
- Chat service refresh/tail/event contracts, DB model constraints, keybindings, tests, and gotchas.

Global SSH, audio, games, profile, rooms/blackjack, observability, and repo-wide test policy stay in the root context.

Core models used by chat live in `late-core/src/models/`:
`chat_room.rs`, `chat_room_member.rs`, `chat_message.rs`, `chat_message_reaction.rs`,
`notification.rs`, `rss_feed.rs`, `rss_entry.rs`, `article.rs`, `article_feed_read.rs`, `showcase.rs`,
`showcase_feed_read.rs`, `work_profile.rs`, and `work_feed_read.rs`.
Chat-owned moderation commands also use `room_ban.rs`,
`server_ban.rs`, `artboard_ban.rs`, and `moderation_audit_log.rs`.

---

## 3. Ownership Split

- `svc.rs` is the async boundary between TUI state, DB models, mention notifications, and broadcast/watch channels.
- `state.rs` owns local chat data, room/message selection, composer state, reply/edit/reaction/pin state, overlays, synthetic-entry substates, unread/read tracking, and cache inputs.
- `input.rs` maps Home chat keys to state/service actions. `handle_message_action_in_room` is shared by Home chat and embedded Rooms chat.
- `ui.rs` renders Home room rail/chat center surfaces and owns `ChatRowsCache`.
- `ui_text.rs` centralizes wrapping for normal messages, the small Markdown subset, reply quotes, `---NEWS---` cards, and reaction footers.

Keep `mod.rs` declaration-only; no `pub use` re-export layer.

---

## 4. Service And Data Flow

`ChatService` channels:
- Per-session `watch<ChatSnapshot>` for low-frequency room summary data.
- `broadcast<ChatEvent>` for live message, reaction, room-command, tail, and error events.
- Shared `watch<Arc<Vec<String>>>` username directory for mention autocomplete, refreshed every 30s.
- A service-owned refresh scheduler that refreshes registered sessions every 10s and on explicit signals.
- `read_permits: Semaphore(8)` to cap concurrent snapshot, tail, discover, and pinned-message reads.
- `send_general_message_task` is the shared internal producer for custom `#general` announcements. It resolves `#general`, optionally joins the author first, then sends through the normal `send_message` path. Rooms uses it silently for seat-join announcements; News uses it with a request id so normal composer-style send success/failure events are preserved.

Important constants in `svc.rs`:
- `HISTORY_LIMIT = 500`
- `DELTA_LIMIT = 256`
- `PINNED_MESSAGES_LIMIT = 100`
- `CHAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 10s`
- `USERNAME_DIRECTORY_TTL = 30s`

Normal display flow:
1. `ChatState::new` subscribes to chat events/usernames and calls `ChatService::start_user_refresh_task`.
2. The per-user snapshot loads joined rooms, unread counts, `#general` id, DM/current-user metadata, bonsai glyphs for those users, and ignored user ids.
3. Snapshots intentionally carry empty message vectors. They do not load history.
4. Visible-room changes call `App::sync_visible_chat_room()`, which stores `visible_room_id`, marks the room read, and requests a room tail.
5. `load_room_tail_task` fetches the newest 500 messages, reaction summaries, author usernames, and author bonsai glyphs for the visible room.
6. Broadcast `MessageCreated`/`MessageEdited`/`MessageDeleted`/reaction events patch local state. Broadcast lag triggers a tail reload for the visible room.

`ChatSnapshot` is summary data. `RoomTailLoaded` is history data. Do not merge those responsibilities back together.

---

## 5. DB Contracts

Room model:
- `chat_rooms.kind`: `general`, `language`, `dm`, `topic`, `game`.
- `chat_rooms.visibility`: `public`, `private`, `dm`.
- `general` must have slug `general`, is public, auto-join, and permanent.
- `language` rooms are public, opt-in, unique by `language_code`, with slug `lang-{code}`.
- `topic` rooms are unique by `(visibility, slug)`.
- `game` rooms are public, opt-in, require `game_kind + slug`, are unique by `(game_kind, slug)`, and DB constraints require `auto_join = false`.
- DMs canonicalize endpoint UUIDs by text order and are unique by `(dm_user_a, dm_user_b)`.

Membership:
- `chat_room_members` primary key is `(room_id, user_id)`.
- `last_read_at` drives unread counts.
- Unread counts exclude messages authored by the current user.
- `join` is idempotent and preserves original `joined_at` on conflict.
- Membership is the authorization check for reading tails, syncing deltas, marking read, sending, reacting, listing members, and inviting.

Messages:
- `chat_messages.body` must be trimmed non-empty and length <= 2000.
- Messages are hard-deleted. There are no tombstones.
- Recent/tail queries return newest-first: `ORDER BY created DESC, id DESC`.
- Delta queries return ascending after `(created, id)` and are inserted into newest-first local state.
- `reply_to_message_id` is nullable and uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
- `pinned` is a global message-level flag with a partial pinned index.

Reactions:
- `chat_message_reactions` primary key is `(message_id, user_id)`.
- Each user has at most one numeric reaction kind `1..=8` per message.
- Message/user deletion cascades remove reactions.

Notifications:
- Mentions are stored in `notifications`.
- Mention unread state is cursor-based through `mention_feed_reads`.
- Mention resolution excludes the actor and recipients who ignore the actor; DMs only notify DM participants, private rooms only members, and non-game public rooms may mention any user. Game-room chat does not create Mentions feed notifications.

---

## 6. Rooms And Selection

`RoomSlot` represents either a real room or one of the synthetic entries: RSS (`RoomSlot::Feeds`), News, Notifications/Mentions, Discover, Showcase, or Work.

Visual order is defined in `state.rs::visual_order_for_rooms` and mirrored by cozy room-rail rendering in `ui.rs`:
1. Favorite real rooms in `users.settings.favorite_room_ids` order.
2. Core permanent rooms: `general`, `announcements`, `suggestions`, `bugs`.
3. Notifications/Mentions.
4. Other non-DM chat-list rooms/channels, excluding favorites.
5. News.
6. RSS, when the current user has at least one RSS/Atom subscription.
7. Showcase.
8. Work.
9. DMs, sorted by unread status, then newest message, then peer display name.
10. Discover / `+ browse rooms`.

RSS:
- RSS subscriptions are per-user and managed in `Settings -> RSS`.
- `rss_feeds` stores connected RSS/Atom URLs; `rss_entries` stores private pending entries.
- The background `FeedService` polls active feeds, parses a conservative RSS/Atom subset, stores unseen entries, and publishes per-user events.
- The RSS synthetic room (`RoomSlot::Feeds`) is private. Press `s` on an entry to share it through `ArticleService::process_url`; only then does it become a public News article and `#general` announcement.
- Enter copies the selected RSS entry URL, `d` dismisses it, and `r` asks the RSS poller to refresh.

Game rooms stay in `ChatState.rooms` for embedded Rooms chat, but `is_chat_list_room` hides them from the Home room rail/navigation and favorite-room picker.

Room navigation:
- `h`/`l`, left/right arrows, `Ctrl+P`/`Ctrl+N` switch room selection.
- `Space` activates room-jump mode, assigning keys from `ROOM_JUMP_KEYS`. Jumping to the already selected room/synthetic entry still re-runs the entry's read/list side effects so stale unread badges clear.
- Global `Ctrl+/` opens the room jump modal. Rows include unread counts and synthetic entries for RSS, News, Showcase, Work, Mentions, and custom room browse. Results are ordered favorites first, then unread entries, then latest message/activity; typed `@` and `#` prefixes filter to DMs or rooms while keeping that ordering.
- While composing on Home, `Ctrl+N`/`Ctrl+P` switch real rooms while preserving draft text and dropping reply/edit state.
- Synthetic entries are selected with booleans (`news_selected`, `notifications_selected`, `discover_selected`, `showcase_selected`, `work_selected`), not `selected_room_id`.

---

## 7. Home Shell And Embedded Chat

There is no top-level `Screen::Chat`. `Screen::Dashboard` renders as Home and owns both the room rail and the chat center:
- If `chat.selected_room_id` is `#general` and no synthetic entry is selected, the center renders `dashboard::ui::draw_dashboard`: optional top activity/quest/shop strip, optional slow wire-news strip, pinned row when present, then general chat. Pinned messages have priority and render whenever present; when vertical space is tight, the wire hides before the top strip.
- If any other real room or synthetic entry is selected, the center renders `chat::ui::draw_chat_center`.
- On wide terminals, `chat::ui::draw_room_list_rail` renders a borderless left rail. On narrow terminals, the center owns the available width.

Room favorites:
- Press `f` on a selected real room to toggle it in `ProfileState::toggle_favorite_room`.
- Press `[` / `]` on a selected favorite to move it up/down via `ProfileState::move_favorite_room`. No-op when the selection isn't a favorite or is already at the edge.
- Favorites are stored in `users.settings.favorite_room_ids` and the vec order drives both the Home room rail and the global picker.
- Favorites are no longer edited through a Settings tab.

Home hot-room shortcuts:
- The right rail renders up to three top multiplayer rooms from `dashboard::ui::top_dashboard_rooms(..., 3)`.
- `b1`, `b2`, and `b3` enter those rooms through the same `rooms::input::enter_room` path used by the Rooms directory.

`App::sync_visible_chat_room()` is the read/tail-load bridge. It computes the visible chat room from Home/Dashboard or Rooms, stores it in `ChatState`, marks it read, and requests a tail on change. Call it after screen, selected room/synthetic entry, room favorite, or active-room changes.

There are separate `ChatRowsCache` instances on `App` for:
- Home general dashboard chat.
- Home chat center for the selected real room/synthetic entry.
- Rooms embedded chat.

Do not share a row cache across surfaces unless width and visible messages are guaranteed identical.

---

## 8. Composer, Commands, Reply, Edit

The main composer is a `ratatui_textarea::TextArea<'static>`.

`composer_room_id` is the authoritative send target while composing. This matters because Home and Rooms do not necessarily drive `selected_room_id` in the same way.

Starting compose in a room:
- Clears message selection.
- Clears reply target.
- Clears edit target.
- Stores `composer_room_id`.

Submit flow in `ChatState::submit_composer`:
- Commands are handled before normal send.
- `/leave` and `/invite` resolve through the active composer room or selected real room. Synthetic entries do not fall back to stale `selected_room_id` values; `/leave` on a selected synthetic entry exits that entry back to the last real room.
- `/members` uses the same real-room resolver as `/leave` and `/invite`.
- Normal send calls `send_message_with_reply_task`.
- Edit calls `edit_message_task`.
- Enter submits and closes.
- `Alt+S` submits and keeps the composer open.
- `Alt+Enter` and `Ctrl+J` insert a newline in the main chat composer.

User commands:
- `/active` opens an overlay from in-memory `active_users`, including repeated-session counts.
- `/binds` opens the Chat help topic.
- `/dm @user` opens/creates a DM.
- `/exit` opens quit confirm.
- `/icons` opens the icon picker (same as `Ctrl+]`).
- `/ignore [@user]` mutes a user or lists muted users.
- `/invite @user` adds a user to the selected non-DM room.
- `/leave` leaves the selected non-permanent room.
- `/list` lists public rooms.
- `/members` lists selected-room members.
- `/mod` opens the moderation command modal; `/mod ...` in chat is rejected because commands run only in the modal.
- `/music` opens music help.
- `/paste-image` asks a paired `late` CLI with `clipboard_image` capability to read the local system clipboard image, sends it back over `/api/ws/pair`, uploads the PNG bytes through the normal image upload path, and inserts the resulting public URL into the composer. Pending clipboard requests time out after 15s so a dead paired client cannot wedge the command.
- `/private #room` creates a private topic room and joins the caller.
- `/profile [@user]` opens a user's read-only profile modal. Bare `/profile` opens the caller's own profile as others see it. `@username` autocompletion is available after `/profile `.
- `/public #room` opens or creates an opt-in public room for the caller only (`auto_join=false`).
- `/settings` opens settings.
- `/unignore [@user]` removes an ignored user.
- `/upload <url>` downloads a public image URL server-side, reuploads it to configured public file storage, and inserts the resulting URL into the composer for the user to send.

Admin commands:
- `/create-room #room` creates/promotes a permanent auto-join room and bulk-adds existing users.
- `/delete-room #room` deletes a permanent room.
- `/fill-room #room` bulk-adds all users to an existing public room and flips `auto_join=true`; private rooms cannot be filled.

Moderation modal commands:
- `rename-room <#oldname> <#newname>`
- `rename-user <@oldname> <@newname>`
- `view <@user|#room|bans|audit|artboard|help> [pagenumber]`
- `artboard restore [YYYY-MM-DD] [reason...]`
- `kick <server|#room> @name [reason...]`
- `ban <server|#room|artboard> @name [duration] [reason...]`
- `unban <server|#room|artboard> @name [reason...]`
- `admin`
- `admin grant mod @name`
- `admin revoke mod @name`

Moderation list pages show 15 rows. Durations use positive `s/m/h/d` suffixes.

Reply mode:
- Captures `ReplyTarget { message_id, author, preview }`.
- Enters compose mode and clears edit.
- On submit, stores `reply_to_message_id` and prefixes the stored body with a visible quote line for backward-compatible rendering.
- Enter on a selected reply jumps only if the target is already loaded in the current room tail.

Edit mode:
- Allowed for the message author or admins.
- Loads the message body into a fresh composer.
- Clears reply.
- Empty edits fail.

Autocomplete:
- `@` filters the shared username directory.
- `/` filters static non-admin chat commands.
- Arrow keys move selection.
- Tab/Enter confirms.
- Esc dismisses popup without leaving compose mode.
- Pressing `/` while not composing on Home starts command compose for the active room, except on News/Showcase/Work where `/` is a synthetic-entry filter toggle.

Image uploads and inline rendering:
- File-upload storage is optional. It is enabled only when `LATE_FILES_S3_ENDPOINT`/`S3_ENDPOINT`, `LATE_FILES_S3_BUCKET`, `LATE_FILES_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and S3 credentials are present. Infra variable details live in `infra/README.md`.
- Pasting raw PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP bytes into the chat composer starts an upload because there is no stable URL to preview until the bytes are hosted.
- Pasting an image URL does not upload or rehost it. It is inserted as normal composer text; after send, inline rendering previews that URL best-effort.
- `/upload <url>` is the explicit URL upload path: it downloads a public image URL server-side, reuploads it to configured public file storage, and inserts the resulting URL into the composer for the user to send and preview.
- `/paste-image` is the explicit paired-CLI clipboard path. It requires an updated `late` paired client, not just browser pairing or plain `ssh`.
- Non-admin uploads use a per-session `ChatState` cooldown. This is intentionally lightweight, not a server-side quota.
- URL downloads for upload and inline rendering must go through `files::image_upload::download_url_bytes`: validate `http(s)`, reject localhost/private/link-local/reserved resolved IPs, pin reqwest DNS to the validated addresses, disable redirects, and stream with a hard byte cap. Do not add new ad hoc `reqwest.get(url).bytes()` paths for chat images.
- Inline image rendering detects likely image URLs in visible room messages, fetches them through the same secure downloader, rejects oversized decoded dimensions, retries transient failures with backoff, and caches rendered terminal lines by message id. Inline previews are best-effort; failures are intentionally silent/noisy only at trace level.

---

## 9. Message Actions

Shared message actions live in `chat::input::handle_message_action_in_room`.

Keys:
- `j` / `k` and arrows move selected message.
- `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` move by an approximate half-page in message units.
- `r` replies.
- `e` edits.
- `d` deletes and moves selection to an adjacent message.
- `p` opens the selected author's read-only profile modal.
- `c` copies the selected message body.
- Enter jumps from a reply to its loaded target.
- `f` enters reaction leader mode.
- `f` again while reaction leader is active opens reaction-owner overlay.
- Digits `1..8` while reaction leader is active toggle reactions, exit reaction leader mode, and keep the message selected.
- `Ctrl+P` toggles selected-message pin state; admin only.

Selection deltas are message-based, not row-based. Positive means older, negative means newer.

---

## 10. Reactions, Pins, Ignores

Reactions:
- One reaction per `(message_id, user_id)`.
- Reaction kinds are `1..8`.
- UI appends reaction footer chips under the message body or news card.
- Reaction summaries live in `message_reactions: HashMap<Uuid, Vec<ChatMessageReactionSummary>>`.
- Reaction-owner overlay waits for a matching `ReactionOwnersListed` event keyed by `pending_reaction_owners_message_id`.

Pins:
- `chat_messages.pinned` is global, not scoped to a room or user.
- Only admins can toggle pins.
- Toggling pin does not optimistically update local pinned dashboard state.
- Home pinned stack comes from `load_pinned_messages_task` through a separate watch channel, not from the 10s summary snapshot.

Ignores:
- `users.settings.ignored_user_ids` stores UUIDs, not usernames.
- `/ignore @user` and `/unignore @user` resolve usernames at command time.
- Ignore filtering applies to non-DM rooms only.
- DMs intentionally bypass ignored-user filtering; leaving the DM room is the dismissal path.
- `IgnoreListUpdated` refilters local non-DM messages in place with no DB refetch, then refreshes the Mentions list/unread count.
- `unignore` does not retroactively restore already-filtered local messages until a future tail/snapshot naturally reloads them.

---

## 11. Synthetic Entries

Synthetic entries are selected from the room list but are not normal `ChatRoom`s.

### News

- Backed by persisted `articles`.
- `ArticleService::process_url` extracts title/summary/image, stores an article, and posts a compact `---NEWS---` announcement into `#general`.
- Announcement payload format is `NEWS_MARKER title || summary || url || ascii`.
- Rendering/parsing of announcement cards lives in `ui_text.rs`.
- Delete removes the article and attempts to delete the matching news announcement by marker/user/url; article deletion can succeed even if chat cleanup only logs a warning.
- URL processing has a 5-minute timeout. Image ASCII fetch has byte, pixel, and time limits.
- News snapshot is global and lists recent articles; unread count is per user through `article_feed_reads`.

### Showcase

- Backed by persisted `showcases`.
- It is a separate feed and does not mirror posts into chat messages.
- Composer fields: title, URL, tags, description.
- `i` creates; `e` edits selected owned/admin entry; `d` deletes owned/admin entry; Enter copies selected URL when not composing.
- Validation requires title, `http://` or `https://` URL, and description.
- Title max is 120 chars; description max is 800 chars.
- Tags normalize lowercase, split on comma/whitespace, strip leading `#`, allow ASCII alnum plus `-_.`, cap each tag at 24 chars and total tags at 8.
- Snapshot is global and lists recent showcases; unread count is per user through `showcase_feed_reads`.

### Work

- Backed by persisted `work_profiles` and `work_feed_reads`.
- It is a separate feed and does not mirror posts into chat messages.
- Each user has at most one work profile; creating again updates the existing profile and preserves its public random slug (`w_` plus 12 lowercase alphanumeric chars).
- Composer fields: headline, status, type, location, contact, links, skills, summary.
- Status must be `open`, `casual`, or `not-looking`; aliases normalize in `work/state.rs`.
- Links require `http://` or `https://`, cap at 6, and are stored for later web rendering.
- Skills normalize lowercase, split on comma/whitespace, strip leading `#`, allow ASCII alnum plus `-_.`, cap each skill at 24 chars and total skills at 12.
- Public profiles show bio and showcases when the author has data for them. The composer does not expose include toggles.
- `i` creates or edits the caller's own profile; `e` edits selected owned/admin entry; `d` deletes owned/admin entry; Enter or `c` copies the selected public work profile link when not composing.
- Snapshot is global and lists recent work profiles by latest update; unread count is per user through `work_feed_reads`.

### Notifications / Mentions

- Backed by `notifications` joined with actor, room, and message preview data.
- Snapshot is user-targeted; consumers must ignore snapshots where `snapshot.user_id != current_user`.
- List and unread queries exclude notifications whose actor is in `users.settings.ignored_user_ids`.
- Selecting Mentions lists notifications and marks all read optimistically; re-selecting Mentions through room-jump or mouse does the same.
- Enter jumps to the referenced room/message when possible.

### Discover

- Lists public topic rooms the current user has not joined.
- Uses `ChatService` events, not a separate service.
- `DiscoverRoomsLoaded { user_id, rooms }` and `DiscoverRoomsFailed { user_id, message }` are user-targeted.
- `start_loading()` clears stale rows until results arrive; empty loaded state is distinct from loading.
- Enter joins the selected public room.

---

## 12. Rendering Constraints

Home chat center:
- The room rail is rendered by `draw_room_list_rail` outside the center pane when the terminal is wide enough.
- The center pane renders messages or a synthetic entry, with the composer at the bottom.
- Composer height is dynamic but capped at 8 lines.

Home general dashboard chat:
- Uses `DashboardChatView`.
- Composer is capped at 5 visible lines.
- Lounge chrome is controlled by the user's Dashboard Header setting, then by vertical priority: pinned row always when present, wire drops first, top activity/quest/shop strip drops second.

Embedded Rooms chat:
- Uses `EmbeddedRoomChatView`.
- Composer is capped at 4 visible lines.
- Game-backed chat rooms are joined through Rooms flow, not the Home room rail.

Message rendering:
- Local message storage is newest-first.
- Rendering reverses to oldest-first rows with newest at the bottom.
- Selected messages replace the leading pad with a selection marker.
- Highlighted reply targets get background styling across the whole row range.
- Message wrapping is word-aware; hard splits are only valid for a single word longer than width.
- Display author labels are plain usernames without leading `@`; mention syntax still uses `@username`.
- Author labels render as `username [special...] [bonsai]`. Special badges come from a hardcoded per-username allowlist in `chat/special_badges.rs` — each name maps to a slice of glyphs (e.g. `[MODERATOR, WRENCH]`), rendered in array order with the first sitting closest to the username. The bonsai glyph comes from `bonsai_glyphs` keyed by user_id. To add, remove, or layer special badges, edit the `SPECIAL_BADGES` const and redeploy.
- The small Markdown subset supports headings, bold, italic, inline code, blockquotes, and simple `- ` list items.
- `---NEWS---` cards use special boxed rendering.

Cache:
- `ChatRowsCache` stores wrapped rows plus selected/highlighted row ranges.
- Its fingerprint includes width, current user, current minute, message fields, usernames, countries, badges, bonsai glyphs, and reactions.
- Composer wrapped rows are cached separately in `ChatState`; invalidate when text or width changes.

Showcase and Work reshuffle their listing on every visit (entering or re-entering the entry via room list, room-jump, or mouse). News keeps its chronological order — only mine-only filtering applies. The slash-command composer in `app/input.rs` skips itself when News/Showcase/Work is selected so `/` reaches the synthetic-entry handler.

When changing keybindings, update root `CONTEXT.md`'s keybinding checklist plus the relevant input handler, help modal, footer hints, and tests.

## 14. Critical Flows

### Send/Edit/Delete

1. Composer submit creates a `request_id`.
2. `send_message_with_reply_task` or `edit_message_task` runs async DB work.
3. Service enforces membership. Reply targets must be in the same room.
4. `#announcements` is admin-only in the send path.
5. Message create/edit broadcasts full `ChatMessage` plus optional `target_user_ids`.
6. Sender receives success/failure ack keyed by `request_id`.
7. Delete hard-deletes by author or admin and broadcasts `MessageDeleted`.

`target_user_ids = None` means public event. `Some(ids)` means scoped event. Consumers rely on this for privacy and notifications.

### Tail And Delta Recovery

1. Visible-room changes request a tail.
2. Tail checks membership and loads newest 500 messages plus reactions and author metadata.
3. Tail merge dedupes by id, sorts newest-first, truncates to 500, and preserves ignored-user filtering.
4. Broadcast lag requests a visible-room tail reload.
5. Delta sync checks membership and loads up to 256 messages after `(created, id)`.

### Room Membership Commands

1. `/public #room` gets or creates a public topic room, forces `auto_join=false`, and joins only caller.
2. `/private #room` creates a private topic room and joins caller.
3. `/invite @user` requires caller membership and rejects DMs.
4. `/leave` rejects permanent rooms.
5. Admin `/fill-room #room` works only for public rooms, bulk-adds all users, and sets `auto_join=true`.
6. DMs always preserve canonical endpoints; sending repairs membership for both endpoints.

### Notifications

1. `send_message` calls `notification_svc.create_mentions_task`.
2. `ChatState` also queues desktop notifications locally for DMs and direct mentions.
3. Render drains `pending_notifications` through user settings in root `render.rs`.

## 15. Performance Notes

Landed/scoped-loading state:
- Username autocomplete is one shared directory watch.
- Per-user snapshots contain summaries only.
- Per-room tails are explicit and capped at 500.
- Discover metadata loads only when Discover is selected.
- Events patch local state and tail loads merge with already-applied live events.

Known risks:
- `ChatRowsCache` fingerprint still hashes visible message bodies and metadata. Keep row cache invalidation correct if changing wrapping/reactions/badges.
- Summary snapshot merge clones preserved message vectors for rooms with empty incoming message lists.
- Unread count SQL counts rows newer than `last_read_at`; if message volume grows, run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Tail reload is the recovery path for lagged broadcasts, so keep it bounded and membership-protected.

Do not reintroduce the old per-session "load every room's history every 10s" behavior.

## 16. Tests

Repo-wide rule from root context still applies:
- Pure unit tests stay inline under `src/`.
- DB/service/network tests go in `late-ssh/tests/chat/`.
- LLM agents must not run `cargo test`, `cargo nextest`, or `cargo clippy`; note expected commands for the human owner instead.

Existing integration coverage:
- `tests/chat/svc.rs`: send, reactions, pins, summaries, room tails, ignored users, discover listing/joining, public room create/fill, delete events, ignore/unignore.
- `tests/chat/news.rs`: article snapshots, empty list, author resolution, duplicate URL failure, direct DB inserts appearing after list refresh.
- `tests/chat/showcase.rs`: create event/snapshot, non-owner update failure, admin delete, unread cursor behavior.
- `tests/chat/work.rs`: profile create/update snapshot behavior, public slug preservation, non-owner update failure, admin delete, unread cursor behavior.
- `tests/chat/state.rs`: placeholder; direct `ChatState` tests need accessors or indirect UI/input tests.

Existing unit coverage:
- `state.rs`: command parsing, autocomplete ranking, visual order, reply preview/target helpers, DM sort keys, textarea theme behavior.
- `input.rs`: room navigation aliases and reaction leader key parsing.
- `ui.rs`: title fitting, composer title degradation, visible rows, room-list rows, hit testing, scroll helpers.
- `ui_text.rs`: news parsing/rendering, reaction footer, wrapping, composer rows.
- Synthetic modules: selection clamp/move helpers, tag parsing, URL validation, payload sanitation, loading transitions.

Test gaps:
- Dedicated notification-service integration tests for mention creation/list/mark-read.
- Direct input-handler tests for News/Showcase/Work/Notifications/Discover.
- Direct `ChatState` synthetic-panel integration tests.
- Full News process success path is hard to cover because extraction depends on AI/search/network behavior.

## 17. Gotchas

- `selected_room_id` is not always the send target. Use `composer_room_id` for active composer submissions.
- `visible_room_id` drives read markers and tail loading.
- Snapshots may contain empty message vectors; empty means preserve existing local tail, not clear history.
- Message storage, recent queries, and tails are newest-first. Delta queries are ascending.
- `(created, id)` is the catch-up cursor.
- Any operation exposing room contents must check membership first.
- DM/private message bodies must not leak to non-members through broadcast handling.
- Ignore filtering is non-DM only.
- `#announcements` admin-only currently depends on the provided `room_slug`; stale/missing slug is a fragile path.
- Reaction and pin tasks are async; UI should not assume optimistic success.
- Pinned messages are loaded separately from summary snapshots and chat events.
- Room visual order must stay consistent between state and UI hit-testing/row-building.
- Mouse hit-testing reconstructs a temporary `ChatRenderInput`; room-list layout changes must keep hit tests in sync.
- News payload fields must sanitize the separator and newlines.
- Showcase and Work posts do not create chat messages; News posts do.
- Game rooms must remain opt-in and `auto_join=false`.
